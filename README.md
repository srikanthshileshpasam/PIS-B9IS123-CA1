# Class Test Question:

A student record consists of:

Student Number (8 digits)
Name
Course code (7 characters)

Administrators would like to register students for courses in any order.

They would like to process students in student number order.

You must create an appropriate data structure for use in an  application, which accepts student records as inputs i.e. add(self,student), and stores them so that retrieve() will give the student record with the lowest student number. 

Please consider execution (retrieval) time, i.e. keep the records sorted.
